<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Muhammad Nur Syafrizal, usually called safril. 
  I am 19 years old and have just graduated from high school, 
  I have a desire to become a fullstack web developer and 
  I have only started studying for about a week.</p>

<p>Becoming a fullstack developer is not that easy,
  there are many new things that
  I have to learn. I started this all from scratch, 
  I really didn't know anything about this at first.
  but I ventured to try new things and start something that might make me better. </p>

<p>I will try to be consistent and continue 
  to get better at learning this and other new things. 
  I have goals that others may not think of.
  pain will be a good friend for my life in the future because it will make me a better person.</p>
